# Install Winget and Applications

This repository contains scripts to install applications using Winget with Azure Image Builder (AIB).

## How It Works
- The `AibInstallWinget.ps1` script ensures that Winget is installed and ready to use on the host.
- All other scripts install specific applications, following a modular approach.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- The Postman installation script (`AibInstallPostman.ps1`) is currently not working and needs investigation.

## üîß Usage
Add the scripts during the Customizations step in Azure Image Builder by clicking `+ Add your own` script and providing the script URL and giving it a name.
1. Add `AibInstallWinget.ps1` first to ensure Winget is available.
2. Add any other script as needed to install specific applications.

This setup ensures a modular and scalable approach for managing applications in Azure Image Builder environments.
